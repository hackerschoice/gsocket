Global Socket allows two users behind NAT/Firewall to establish a TCP
connection with each other. Securely. Abandon the thinking that an IP Address
is needed to communicate with somebody. Instead start thinking that two users
should be able to communicate with each other as long as they know the same
secret (key/password). The Global Socket library handles the rest.
